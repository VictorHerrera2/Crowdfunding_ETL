Project 2 by Steve Marsicek and Victor Herrera

We have 2 seperate note books.  One by Victor, one by Steve.   

In Victor's notebook, you will find the "Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames" section and the "Create the Campaign DataFrame" section of the project.  

In Steve's notebook you will find the "Create the Contacts DataFrame" section of the project. 

All CSV files created can be found in the resouces folder.    

Snips of the tables loaded into PGA admin are the image files with the word "snip" included in the title.
